# AirPnp

AirPnp discovers and exposes UPnP media renderers as AirPlay devices on the network.
Apparently, some media renderers only play content on actual UPnP media servers, so
AirPnp piggybacks on PS3 Media Server for that reason.

AirPnp was originally written in Python, but I failed to find any robust, up-to-date
Python media server with a decent programmatic interface, so I decided to go for 
Scala and PS3 Media Server instead.

**Note**: I'm in the process of migrating the Python code from old AirPnp into this
repository, converting it into Scala. Thus, the code you see here is not read yet.
